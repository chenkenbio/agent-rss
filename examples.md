# Liked Papers
Papers I want to see - use these as positive examples

## Example 1
- **Title**: Deep learning predicts RNA splicing from sequence
- **Abstract**: We developed a deep neural network to predict splicing patterns directly from primary sequence
- **Reason**: Combines deep learning with RNA biology, directly relevant to my research

## Example 2
- **Title**: Transformer model for protein structure prediction
- **Reason**: Novel ML architecture applied to structural biology

# Disliked Papers
Papers I don't want - use these as negative examples

## Example 1
- **Title**: Clinical trial results for cancer drug
- **Reason**: Pure clinical study, no computational methods

## Example 2
- **Title**: Survey of machine learning in healthcare
- **Reason**: Review paper, not original research
